# Sparta
A simple dynamic module for Joomla 3.x
You may select as many as pictures you would like, then set other options to your interface in joomla.
Do not forget you might not need to have jQuery library included, that depends on the libraries already included in your website.
The Logic to Sparta is based on a simple jQuery plugin, actually too simple to be explained , yet you may email me at :
